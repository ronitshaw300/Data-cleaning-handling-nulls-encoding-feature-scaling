# Data-cleaning-handling-nulls-encoding-feature-scaling
Objective:
Learn how to clean and prepare raw data for Machine Learning. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical data, and detecting/removing outliers.

Tools Used:
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn

 Dataset:
We used the Titanic Dataset from Kaggle.

 Steps Performed:
Data Import & Exploration

Loaded the dataset

Checked for null values and data types

Handling Missing Values

Imputed missing values using mean, median, and other strategies

Categorical Encoding

Applied Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables

Feature Scaling

Normalized and standardized numerical features

Outlier Detection

Used boxplots to detect outliers

Removed significant outliers where necessary

What I Learned:
Basics of data cleaning

Importance of handling missing and categorical data

Difference between normalization and standardization

Outlier detection techniques
